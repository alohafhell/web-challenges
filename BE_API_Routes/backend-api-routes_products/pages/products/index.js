// Import the useSWR hook, create a fetcher and fetch /api/products.
// Map over the fetched data object to create a list of all products
// where you display their information.
// Switch to the browser and open /products: you should now see a
// (rarely styled) list of all products.
// âœ¨ Great work, you've consumed your own api route to display its data in the frontend!
